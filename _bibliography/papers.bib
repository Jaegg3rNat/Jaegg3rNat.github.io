abstract ={We study the role of fluctuations in particle systems modeled by Dean-Kawasaki-type equations,
which describe the evolution of particle densities in systems with Brownian motion.
By comparing microscopic simulations, stochastic partial differential equations, and their deterministic counterparts,
we analyze four models of increasing complexity. Our results identify macroscopic quantities that
can be altered by the conserved multiplicative noise that typically appears in the Dean-Kawasaki-type description.
We find that this noise enhances front propagation in systems with density-dependent diffusivity,
accelerates the onset of pattern formation in particle systems with nonlocal interactions, and reduces hysteresis in systems interacting via repulsive forces.
In some cases, it accelerates transitions or induces structures absent in deterministic models.
These findings illustrate that (conservative) fluctuations can have constructive and nontrivial effects,
emphasizing the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding collective particle dynamics.},

abstract ={Environmental flows shape spatial patterns and population dynamics;
however, we do not fully understand how they influence the onset of pattern formation and population abundance.
By combining numerical simulations and analytical approximations, we show that the spatial structure of the flow‚Äôs velocity field determines the pattern formation instability in two nonlocal models of population dynamics. For a simple shear flow, where one of the primary axes of the population pattern can align with the flow, the onset of pattern formation remains unaffected. In contrast, a vortex flow delays the pattern instability relative to the no-flow case. The velocity field, therefore, interacts with the spatial feedbacks driving pattern formation in complex ways, which also leads to different oscillatory time series of population abundance.
Depending on the flow, population abundance may exhibit regular oscillations with a characteristic frequency or long, erratic transients before settling into a more stable regime.},

 	abstract = "In this thesis, we address various out-of equilibrium dynamical problems. In the first chapter, we employ a traditional quantum field theory approach based on the MartinSiggia-Rose-Janssen-deDominicis formalism to construct a generating functional. We then compute the Dynamical Renormalization Group equations for the order parameter, driven by a multiplicative stochastic coupling. We report a novel critical point induced by this multiplicative coupling. In chapters 2 and 3, we apply the same formalism to study the continuum limit of Active and Passive Brownian particles, revealing regimes where pattern formation may emerge under both local and non-local interacting potentials.
Finally, in chapter 4, we investigate pattern formation in environments influenced by static flow currents, focusing on how environmental flow affects population abundance and spatial pattern organization.",

  abstract = {We investigate a two-dimensional system of interacting active Brownian particles. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis formalism, we built up the generating functional for correlation functions. We study in detail the hydrodynamic regime with a constant density stationary state. Our findings reveal that, within a small density fluctuations regime, an emergent ùëà‚Å°(1) gauge symmetry arises, originated from the conservation of fluid vorticity. Consequently, the interaction between the orientational order parameter and density fluctuations can be cast into a gauge theory, where the concept of ‚Äúelectric charge density‚Äù aligns with the local vorticity of the original fluid. We study in detail the case of a microscopic local two-body interaction. We show that, upon integrating out the gauge fields, the stationary states of the rotational degrees of freedom satisfy a nonlocal Frank free energy for a nematic fluid. We give explicit expressions for the splay and bend elastic constants as a function of the P√©clet number (Pe) and the diffusion interaction constant (ùëòùëë).},

abstract = {We study the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in the description of the dynamics of an order parameter near a critical point. We study equilibrium as well as out-of-equilibrium properties. By means of a functional formalism, we build the Dynamical Renormalization Group equations for a real scalar order parameter with Z2 symmetry, driven by a class of multiplicative stochastic processes with the same symmetry. We compute the flux diagram using a controlled œµ-expansion, up to order œµ2. We find that, for dimensions d=4‚àíœµ, the additive dynamic fixed point is unstable. The flux runs to a multiplicative fixed point driven by a diffusion function G(œï)=1+g‚àóœï2(x)/2, where œï is the order parameter and g‚àó=œµ2/18 is the fixed point value of the multiplicative noise coupling constant. We show that, even though the position of the fixed point depends on the stochastic prescription, the critical exponents do not. Therefore, different dynamics driven by different stochastic prescriptions (such as It√¥, Stratonovich, anti-It√¥ and so on) are in the same universality class.}

The magnetic state equation and entropy were considered in the framework of Handrich‚ÄìKaneyoshi model, which takes into account the amorphization through the symmetric exchange fluctuation in the mean field approximation. The exchange and structural fluctuations parameters were chosen based on the experimental data of Eu80Au20. The isothermal entropy change was calculated for several variations of external magnetic field. Furthermore, the adiabatic temperature change and the refrigerant capacity were calculated for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5T.}

By means of the Martin‚ÄìSiggia‚ÄìRose‚ÄìJenssen‚Äìde Dominicis formalism, we built up a generating functional for correlations functions. In the continuum limit, we uncover an exact symmetry under area-preserving diffeomorphism transformations that characterizes a liquid state. This symmetry leads to the conservation of local vorticity. By computing the generating functional within the saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuations approximation, we reveal the emergence of a U(1) gauge symmetry that allows us to describe the dynamics of density fluctuations as a gauge theory. We solve the corresponding equations of motion for short as well as long ranged interactions showing up the presence of multiple dynamical regimes and associated dynamical phase transitions, even for pure repulsive interactions.}
