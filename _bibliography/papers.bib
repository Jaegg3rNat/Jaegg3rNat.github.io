  abstract = {We investigate a two-dimensional system of interacting active Brownian particles. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis formalism, we built up the generating functional for correlation functions. We study in detail the hydrodynamic regime with a constant density stationary state. Our findings reveal that, within a small density fluctuations regime, an emergent ùëà‚Å°(1) gauge symmetry arises, originated from the conservation of fluid vorticity. Consequently, the interaction between the orientational order parameter and density fluctuations can be cast into a gauge theory, where the concept of ‚Äúelectric charge density‚Äù aligns with the local vorticity of the original fluid. We study in detail the case of a microscopic local two-body interaction. We show that, upon integrating out the gauge fields, the stationary states of the rotational degrees of freedom satisfy a nonlocal Frank free energy for a nematic fluid. We give explicit expressions for the splay and bend elastic constants as a function of the P√©clet number (Pe) and the diffusion interaction constant (ùëòùëë).},

abstract = {We study the role of multiplicative stochastic processes in the description of the dynamics of an order parameter near a critical point. We study equilibrium as well as out-of-equilibrium properties. By means of a functional formalism, we build the Dynamical Renormalization Group equations for a real scalar order parameter with Z2 symmetry, driven by a class of multiplicative stochastic processes with the same symmetry. We compute the flux diagram using a controlled œµ-expansion, up to order œµ2. We find that, for dimensions d=4‚àíœµ, the additive dynamic fixed point is unstable. The flux runs to a multiplicative fixed point driven by a diffusion function G(œï)=1+g‚àóœï2(x)/2, where œï is the order parameter and g‚àó=œµ2/18 is the fixed point value of the multiplicative noise coupling constant. We show that, even though the position of the fixed point depends on the stochastic prescription, the critical exponents do not. Therefore, different dynamics driven by different stochastic prescriptions (such as It√¥, Stratonovich, anti-It√¥ and so on) are in the same universality class.}

abstract = {In this work, we investigated the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the amorphous system Eu80Au20. The magnetic state equation and entropy were considered in the framework of Handrich‚ÄìKaneyoshi model, which takes into account the amorphization through the symmetric exchange fluctuation in the mean field approximation. The exchange and structural fluctuations parameters were chosen based on the experimental data of Eu80Au20. The isothermal entropy change was calculated for several variations of external magnetic field. Furthermore, the adiabatic temperature change and the refrigerant capacity were calculated for a magnetic field change from 0 to 5T.}

abstract = {We investigate collective behavior of a system of two-dimensional interacting Brownian particles in the hydrodynamic regime. By means of the Martin‚ÄìSiggia‚ÄìRose‚ÄìJenssen‚Äìde Dominicis formalism, we built up a generating functional for correlations functions. In the continuum limit, we uncover an exact symmetry under area-preserving diffeomorphism transformations that characterizes a liquid state. This symmetry leads to the conservation of local vorticity. By computing the generating functional within the saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuations approximation, we reveal the emergence of a U(1) gauge symmetry that allows us to describe the dynamics of density fluctuations as a gauge theory. We solve the corresponding equations of motion for short as well as long ranged interactions showing up the presence of multiple dynamical regimes and associated dynamical phase transitions, even for pure repulsive interactions.}
